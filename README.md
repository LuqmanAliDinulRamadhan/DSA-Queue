A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element into the queue will be the first element out of the queue. A queue can be thought of as a queue where new elements are added at one end of the queue (rear/back/tail) and existing elements are removed at the other end (front/head). The process of adding data to a queue is called Enqueue, while the process of deleting data from a queue is called Dequeue.

In the queue there is also an IsEmpty operation which is used to check whether the Queue is empty or not. If the Queue has no elements, the Queue is empty, and this operation will return true. If the Queue has elements, it means the Queue is not empty, and this operation will return false. There is also a Size operation used to get the number of elements in the Queue. Using this operation, we can find out how many elements are currently in the Queue without changing the structure or removing elements.
